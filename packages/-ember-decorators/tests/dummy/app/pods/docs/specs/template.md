# Specs

Ember Decorators follows the [current decorators "stage 2" proposal specs](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-decorators).
The [`@ember-decorators/utils`](https://github.com/ember-decorators/ember-decorators/tree/master/packages/utils)
package normalizes the preceding [legacy decorators "stage 1" proposal API](https://github.com/loganfsmyth/babel-plugin-transform-decorators-legacy#why-legacy)
to the current one, so that you don't have to worry about it.

These two documents from the spec repo are especially helpful:

- [`METAPROGRAMMING.md`](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-decorators/blob/master/METAPROGRAMMING.md):
  how to write and use decorators
- [`TABLE.md`](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-decorators/blob/master/TABLE.md):
  detailed API docs for the decorator input parameter and output return value
